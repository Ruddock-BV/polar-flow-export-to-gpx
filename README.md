# Polar Flow Export to GPX

In [your Polar account](https://account.polar.com/) you can request to download all your data. When the download is available you will get a zip file containing information in JSON format.

The files that start with `Planned-Route` will contain your routes available in your Polar Favorites. This tool will allow you to convert these JSON-files to GPX files. Allowing you to import these files into any other compatible tool.

The tool is hosted [here](https://ruddock-bv.github.io/polar-flow-export-to-gpx/convert.html)
